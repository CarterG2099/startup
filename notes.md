# Notes
- I learned what markdown is and how to style this file
- Commit essentially saves your changes, push then updates the changes to main file and pull updates file on separate computer

- **IP Address** http://50.19.114.36
- **Technology Stack:** Software that a particular company uses to develop/maintain their product. There are acronyms for more common stacks but most stacks are dependent upon company needs

## Quick Copy
- ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/.ssh/keypair260.pem -h pronutrilog.click -s startup
- ssh -i keypair260.pem ubuntu@pronutrilog.click

## AWS EC2
- Instance: Virtual Server that uses hardware in N Virginia
- Terminating: Destroys virtual server
- Stopping: Powers down device
- Elastic IP Address:
    - Allows for server to stop without changing IP Address
## AWS Route 53
- Creating Domain name allows for HTTPS - not available with just an ip address
- **DNS**: Domain Name System
  - **Domain Name**: pronutrilog.click
  - **IP Address**: Unique for each device. DNS translates it to domain name.
  - **DNS Record**: Contains information that maps domain names to specific resources, such as IP addresses or other services
      - A type record: Represents root domain and public IP Address
      - Wildcard subdomain (*) allows for any subdomain (recipe.pronutrilog.click)
      - SOA (Start of Authority) Record: Provides contact information about the owner of this domain name.
      - NS (Name Server) Record: Contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize you to place DNS records in this DNS server.
- **TLD**: Top-Level Domain: Organize and group sites (.click)
## Caddy 
- Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service
- **Gateway/Reverse Proxy:** Ability to route requests and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service
- **HTML Files:** Are served by caddy in the **public** directory when sshing
## HTTPS TLS Web Certificates
- **HTTPS:** ( Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol ) Secure Connection using **TLS** that defines the rules for how messages are formatted and transmitted over the internet and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.
- **TLS:** works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data.
- **Web Certificates:**
    - Generated by third party company
    - The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate.
    - Certificates have to be renewed - Caddy uses "Let's Encrypt" to safely and freely renew the certification with new encryption.
    - **ACME** is the protocol for communication between certificate authorities. (Built into Caddy and many other softwares)
 
## HTML
- Stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage
- table structure:
    - table - thead - tr - td
    - ul - li

## Review
- You can load fonts from Google with
- CSS Box Model: Margin, Border, Padding, Content
- Padding puts space around content
- chmod +x deploy.sh makes script executable
      - sudo executes the file
- var: function scoped
- let: block scoped within {}

## TCP/IP Layers
- Application: (HTTPS)	Functionality like web browsing
- Transport: (TCP) Moving connection information packets
- Internet: (IP) Establishing connections
- Link:	(Google Fiber) Hardware	Physical connections

## Regular Expression Syntax
**Literal Characters:**
Matches the character itself: a, b, c, !, $, etc.

**Metacharacters:**
- . (dot): Matches any single character except newline.
- ^ (caret): Matches the beginning of the string.
- $ (dollar sign): Matches the end of the string.
- [] (square brackets): Matches a character set. Ex: [abc] matches any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
- - (hyphen): Defines a range within a character set. Ex: [a-z] matches any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.
- \w (word character): Matches any alphanumeric character or underscore.
- \d (digit): Matches any single digit (0-9).
- \s (whitespace): Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).
- \b (word boundary): Matches the boundary between a word and a non-word character.

**Quantifiers:**
- '*' (asterisk): Matches the preceding character zero or more times. Ex: ab*c matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", etc.
- '+' (plus sign): Matches the preceding character one or more times. Ex: ab+c matches "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", etc., but not "ac".
- '?' (question mark): Matches the preceding character zero or one time. Ex: colou?r matches both "color" and "colour".
- {n}: Matches the preceding character exactly n times. Ex: ab{2}c matches "abbc".
- {n,m}: Matches the preceding character at least n but no more than m times. Ex: a{2,3}b matches "aabb" or "aaab".

**Grouping:**
- () (parentheses): Groups characters to define a subexpression. Ex: (ab)+c matches "abcabcabc".
  
**Backreferences:**
- '\n' (backslash followed by a number): Matches the nth captured group in the pattern. Ex: (\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4}) captures three groups of digits in a phone number format.

**Special Sequences:**
- '\t': Matches a tab character.
- '\n': Matches a newline character.
- '\r': Matches a carriage return character.

**Flags:**
- i (case-insensitive): Makes the pattern case-insensitive.
- g (global): Matches all occurrences of the pattern in the string.
- m (multiline): Treats the string as multiple lines for anchors like ^ and $.
